      <description>Sometime during 2018 I had the very original idea of starting my own blog. So, I started one, and then forgot about it, and now I&amp;rsquo;ve started another one. Thankfully, my previous experience had taught my just how hard it can be to think of new ideas for blog posts, which is why I came prepared this time.
For my first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about how I set up this blog.</description>
