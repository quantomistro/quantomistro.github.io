      <description>this blog I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to write here? It&amp;rsquo;s just another blog. I write about my opinions and likes and dislikes and put them here.
me My name&amp;rsquo;s M------ S----, but I go by quantomistro in most places on the internet. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember why I chose &amp;ldquo;quantomistro&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it involved some random word generators and my interest in quantum-anything and astronomy. I was born in January of 2003 (it&amp;rsquo;s easier to put my date of birth instead of writing my age and having to update it every year).</description>

      <description>Sometime during 2018 I had the very original idea of starting my own blog. So, I started one, and then forgot about it, and now I&amp;rsquo;ve started another one. Thankfully, my previous experience had taught my just how hard it can be to think of new ideas for blog posts, which is why I came prepared this time.
For my first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about how I set up this blog.</description>
